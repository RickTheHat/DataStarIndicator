# DataStar > Indicator
### >>> built using [ASP.NET Core Web Apps](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet)

This repository contains two implementations of an Indicator functionality using DataStar:

1. ****not*** working* > An [ASP.NET Core Web App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/intro?view=aspnetcore-9.0) (Model-View-Controller)
2. ****not*** working* > An [ASP.NET Core Web App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro?view=aspnetcore-9.0&tabs=visual-studio) (Razor Pages)

**Clicking the button does not work on either project currently...**

## What is DataStar?

DataStar is a lightweight hypermedia framework that brings reactive functionality to server-rendered applications. It combines the best of both worlds:

- The simplicity and reliability of server-side rendering
- The dynamic, reactive user experience in the style of a Single Page Application (SPA) but without the need for JavaScript

## Benefits

- **Build Like a Pro, Code Like a Beginner**: Create sophisticated, reactive web applications without wrestling with complex state management or JavaScript frameworks
- **Real-Time Magic**: Update multiple parts of your page instantly - imagine a chat application where messages, user lists, and notifications all update in real-time without writing a single line of JavaScript
- **Your Server, Your Rules**: Keep all your business logic where it belongs - on the server. No more duplicating validation rules or business logic in JavaScript
- **Learn Once, Build Anything**: If you can build a traditional web page, you can build reactive applications. No need to learn Redux, React, or complex state management patterns
- **Instant Feedback**: Create responsive interfaces that feel like native apps - type in a search box and watch results filter instantly, all without complex client-side code
- **Focus on Features, Not Plumbing**: Spend your time building features users love instead of managing state, writing JavaScript, or debugging client-server communication

## Why Use DataStar?

- **Minimal JavaScript**: Just include a single 12.9 KiB file - smaller than Alpine.js and Htmx combined
- **HATEOAS Compliant**: The only JavaScript you need is the library itself - no additional client-side code required
- **Server Technology Agnostic**: Write your backend in any language
- **Real-time Updates**: Utilizes server-sent events for fast, responsive experiences

## About This Example

The DataStar Indicator Demo showcases the integration of DataStar.js to create a responsive and interactive web application. This demo features a simple interface where users can click a button to trigger a loading indicator, demonstrating real-time data fetching capabilities. By leveraging DataStar.js, the application efficiently manages asynchronous requests and updates the UI dynamically without page reloads. The demo highlights how DataStar.js can be used to enhance user experience by providing immediate visual feedback during data operations, making it an excellent choice for applications that require smooth and responsive interactions.

## Getting Started

Both implementations demonstrate how to:
- Set up DataStar in an [ASP.NET Core Web App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/intro?view=aspnetcore-9.0)
- Implement real-time search functionality
- Handle server-sent events
- Structure your application for reactive behavior
